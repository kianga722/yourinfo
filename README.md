## Summary

* Built primarily using React, the [ipifiy](https://www.ipify.org/) API, and the [ipdata](https://ipdata.co/) API
* Displays visitor's IP Address, location, and information that can be obtained from the browser
* Motivation was to develop skills in React by building a simple web app

## Future Improvements

* Deal with add-ons like uBlock Origin that interfere with the API calls
